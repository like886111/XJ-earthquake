# XJ-earthquake
This code is based on the ETAS model to study the seismic events in Xinjiang region from 2009 to 2023, and now the code is developed from this repository
Official implementation of our paper, "Spatio-temporal Characterization Of Seismic Sequence Parameters And Prediction Of Strong Aftershocks In Xinjiang Based On The ETAS Model".


### Introduction
We use the integrated nested Laplace algorithm (INLA) to fit the prevalent Aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, study the spatial activity characteristics of seismic sequences in different regions of Xinjiang, and estimate the parameters of ETAS model.

## Usage:
### 1. Requirements
The operating system used in our study is MAC OS.
R == 4.3.1
The rest of the R package is in "session.info.Rds"
### 2. Datasets
The research data we used is available at "https://data.earthquake.cn/datashare/report.shtml?PAGEID=earthquake_subao"
### 3. Details
"XJ_code.R":Code for model calculations and plotting.
"XJ_functions.R" and "XJ_functions.R":Definitions of the functions used to fit the model and other.
